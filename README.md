# JavaScript Level Up

The purpose of this document is to serve as a resource for anyone who wants to level up their JavaScript and
Web Development chops.

The topics I've selected here are specifically designed to take you from a JS beginner to someone
who has a much deeper and more nuanced understanding of the language.

Therefore, this document will be most useful
for people who already have basic knowledge of JavaScript. In other words, you know what functions
and variables are, you know how to string them together to perform basic calculations, you may have heard of classes,
you've heard of `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` but don't quite understand how to use them, you know JavaScript is really
fast at I/O (input/output) but you don't know why, your understanding of the `this` keyword could be improved, etc.

Since there's already a vast amount of amazing resources on the internet for all of the aforementioned topics, I won't be doing a deep dive into any of them. Rather, I'll explain the basic concept and show a few relevant code examples if necessary, and then link to further reading on the topics. Over the past few years, I've bookmarked and curated great examples, code snippets, and videos that were instrumental in my learning and that I would love to pass on.

So, without further ado, let's level up!
